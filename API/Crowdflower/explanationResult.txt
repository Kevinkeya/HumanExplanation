From Greenwich Railway Station (GNW) depart for Royal Opera House, Soho Gym, The Hippodrome Casino, Jamie's Italian or British Luxury Club, if you are near a place to disassociate or have a drink while you wait. It is necessary to take into account that in the weekend there are events in many places and the station is very massified, reason why I recommend to be placed in the center at the time of catching the wagon so that it is more comfortable and fast to mount
